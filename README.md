# HOSTILE SEEDER

A small seeder file that makes a GET request to a countries API, retrieves the countries, and saves them as documents in a Mongo countries collection.

# RUN
```bash
node seed.js
```

# What can go wrong?
- You do not have Mongo installed
- You might not have Mongo running
- You do not have an internet connection
- Run! there is a zombie behind you!
